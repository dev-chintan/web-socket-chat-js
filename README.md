# WebSocket Chat Application

## Project Overview

I developed this project as an educational exercise to deepen my understanding of WebSockets. Utilizing the guidance provided by the MDN documentation, I created this chat application to explore and implement WebSocket functionalities.

This project demonstrates a basic WebSocket server implementation in Node.js. The server performs the WebSocket handshake, manages connected clients, and handles the exchange of data frames between the server and the clients.
